# Superface Comlink & OneSDK Production Example

This example demonstrates how to use Comlink files created using the [Superface CLI](https://github.com/superfaceai/cli) in a production setting with [OneSDK](https://github.com/superfaceai/one-sdk).

## Overview

The use case in this example is "sending an email". To do this, we are using the API of the email provider [Resend.com](https://resend.com).

The associated Comlink profile and Comlink map required by OneSDK for this use case were generated using the Superface CLI. You can see those files in the `superface` directory.

This example is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) application using [Express](https://expressjs.com/) to create a server that will accept `POST` requests to an `/execute` endpoint, which will then invoke OneSDK to perform the use case tasks and send an email.

## Prerequisites

To work with this example you will need Node.js version 18.17.0 or higher, as well as [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/).

To use [Resend](https://resend.com/) as the email API provider, you will need to register an account and create an API key. You must also verify the domain you want to send from, otherwise sending will be limited to the email address of the account holder only.

## Running the example

Start by cloning this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/superfaceai/nodejs-production-example.git
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file and add your SUPERFACE_ONESDK_TOKEN and the RESEND_TOKEN for the Resend API:

```bash
SUPERFACE_ONESDK_TOKEN=
RESEND_TOKEN=
```

Run the server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will run the development server using Nodemon on port 3000. The `/execute` endpoint is now available.

## Test the endpoint

With the server running, make a `POST` request using a tool or your choice such as [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), [HTTPie](https://httpie.io/) or [RapidAPI](https://paw.cloud/), to:

```bash
http://localhost:3000/execute
```

With the following JSON object as the body:

_HINT: Don't forget to replace the email addresses with real ones._

```json
{
  "to": "replace-with-your-email",
  "from": "replace-with-your-from-email",
  "subject": "Hello, World!",
  "text": "Hello, from Superface!"
}
```

For example, using cURL:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/execute -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ "to": "replace-with-your-email", "from": "replace-with-your-from-email", "subject": "Hello, World!", "text": "Hello, from Superface!"}'
```

On success you will see the `id` of the email sent returned from Resend.

If the request fails, you will get an error response from OneSDK.

## Deploying to production

If everything works locally, the next step would be to modify any aspects of `server.mjs` to your liking and deploy it to production.

### Production environment caveats

Your production environment choice is up to you, but please note that you will need to be able to control the following:

- The version of Node.js that runs on the server so you can set it to v18.7.0 or higher.
- The command used to run the Node.js script, so you can include the required `--experimental-wasi-unstable-preview1` flag.
- Ideally, a memory limit that is higher than 1MB for each process, as the fully packaged OneSDK bundle is around this size.

### Example - Deploy to Fly.io

Fly.io is a service that can handle fast deploys hosted in regions of your choice. For example purposes, here's how to deploy this application with them.

Install the Fly.io tools

```bash
brew install flyctl
```

Launch a new machine:

```bash
fly launch
```

Make a small modification to the `fly.toml` file created at the root of the app and add:

```toml
[build]
  [build.args]
    NODE_VERSION = "19"

[processes]
  web = "node --experimental-wasi-unstable-preview1 server.mjs"

[http_service]
  internal_port = 3000
  force_https = true
  auto_stop_machines = true
  auto_start_machines = true
  min_machines_running = 0
  processes = ["web"]
```

This ensures that the right version of Node.js will be used, and that the server will be run using the `--experiment-wasi-unstable-preview1` flag.

Then, add the content from your `.env` file to the ENV on the server:

```bash
fly secrets set SUPERFACE_ONESDK_TOKEN=yourtoken

fly secrets set RESEND_TOKEN=yourresendtoken
```

Then deploy the app to Fly.io

```bash
fly deploy
```

After a successful deployment you will be able to access the same `/execute` endpoint at:

```bash
https://<your-app-name>.fly.dev/execute
```
